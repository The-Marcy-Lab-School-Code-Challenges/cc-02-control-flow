## Code Problems

1. Create a function `betweenFiveAndTen` that takes in an integer, and if that integer is between 5 and 10, it will return true or false.
```
betweenFiveAndTen(5) //returns true
betweenFiveAndTen(15) //returns false 
```

2. Create a function `betweenTenAndThirty` that takes in an integer, and if that integer is between 10 and 30 it will return true or false.
```
betweenTenAndThirty(10) //returns false
betweenTenAndThirty(15) //returns true
```

3. Create a function `betweenThirtyAndFifty` that takes in an integer, and if that integer is between 30 and 50 it will return true or false.
```
betweenThirtyAndFifty(30) //returns true
betweenThirtyAndFifty(55) //returns false
```

4. Create a function `betweenThirtyFiftySeventy` that takes in an integer, and if that integer is between 0 and 30 or between 50 and 70 it will return true or false.
```
betweenThirtyFiftySeventy(0) //returns true
betweenThirtyFiftySeventy(44) //returns false
betweenThirtyFiftySeventy(55) //returns true
betweenThirtyFiftySeventy(71) //returns false
```

5. Create a function `betweenTwentyFiftySixty` that takes in an integer, and if that integer is between 0 and 20 or between 50 and 60 it will return true or false.
```
betweenTwentyFiftySixty(12) //returns true
betweenTwentyFiftySixty(44) //returns false
betweenTwentyFiftySixty(55) //returns true
betweenTwentyFiftySixty(61) //returns false
```

6. Create a function `betweenTenTwentyThirty` that takes in an  integer, and if that integer is between 0 and 10 or between 20 and 30 it will return true or false
```
betweenTenTwentyThirty(0) //returns true
betweenTenTwentyThirty(9) //returns true
betweenTenTwentyThirty(22) //returns true
betweenTenTwentyThirty(31) //returns false
```
